Having completed a PhD in astronomy in 2021, I wished to expand on the programming and analysis skills I had developed during my research. I have spent the past year expanding my skill set to include such things as machine learning, data visualisation, and querying a wide range of databases through Coursera courses and Kaggle public competitions. I am currently taking a course on data analysis using SQL. A portfolio showing examples of my work is hosted on my GitHub page. I love the challenge of investigating data, discovering the potential insights contained within, and seek to grow my skill sets to meet these challenges.\\
